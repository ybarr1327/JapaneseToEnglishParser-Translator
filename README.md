Each Branch is the different parts of the project, part A part B part C <br />
Part A - Scanner <br />
Part B - Parser <br />
Part C - Translator <br />

Each sucessive part includes the previous step, for example part c includes parts a and b

Purpose of the project:
This project was meant to simulate the process of what it would be like to write different parts of a compiler.<br />

Using a limited subset of Japanese words, we were able to follow some steps which included scanning the text and turning the characters into tokens, parsing these tokens, and finally converting the parsed tokens to English meaning. By doing this project we basiacally learned about the many steps that a complier would take to convert raw c++ code and turn it into the assembly language for the cpu to run.
